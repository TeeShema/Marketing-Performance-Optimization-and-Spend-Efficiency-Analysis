# Business Problem
Despite strong brand reach and multiple active campaigns, the business lacked clarity on which marketing efforts were truly driving value.

Key challenges included:

•	High impressions but inconsistent conversion outcomes

•	Marketing spend is distributed evenly without clear ROI prioritization

•	Engagement metrics available, but weak connection to revenue impact

•	Limited insight into how platform, audience, content, and timing interact

Without a structured performance analysis, marketing decisions risked being driven by assumptions rather than evidence, leading to inefficient spend and missed growth opportunities.

# The Need to Act
Continuing to distribute budget evenly across campaigns, platforms, and audiences risks:

•	Overinvesting in high-engagement but low-return activities

•	Underscaling high-ROI platforms and audiences

•	Leaving conversion growth unrealized despite strong reach

Acting on these insights enables the business to increase ROI without increasing spend, improving both efficiency and predictability of marketing outcomes.

# Business Objectives
The objectives of this analysis were to:

•	Assess funnel efficiency from impressions to conversions

•	Identify high-ROI campaigns and underperforming initiatives

•	Evaluate platform and audience profitability, not just engagement

•	Understand how content type, theme, and timing affect performance

•	Translate insights into actionable recommendations to improve marketing efficiency

# Key Business Questions

1.	Where are users dropping off in the marketing funnel?

2.	Which campaigns generate the highest return relative to cost?

3.	Which platforms deliver the strongest balance of CPA and ROAS?

4.	Which audiences are most profitable across platforms?
5.	What content formats, themes, and posting times drive the best engagement and support conversions?

# ANALYSIS & INSIGHTS
 
# Insight 1 
**Funnel Scale Is Strong, but Efficiency Is the Bottleneck**

<img width="523" height="428" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/576fc05a-8755-4ae0-b728-e0310f854096" />

The marketing funnel generated 12.2M impressions, resulting in 319,458 clicks (≈ 2.6% CTR) and 39,697 conversions (≈ 12.4% CVR from click to conversion).
While awareness is strong, over 87% of users who clicked did not convert, indicating significant mid-funnel leakage. 
The business is paying primarily for visibility, not outcomes. 
Awareness is not the bottleneck; conversion efficiency is.
At this scale, a 1% improvement in conversion rate would unlock 3,000-4,000 additional conversions without increasing spend.

**Recommendations:**

•	Optimize landing pages and post-click experience (page speed, messaging clarity, CTA alignment).

•	Align ad copy more tightly with landing page intent.


# Insight 2  
**ROI Improved Year-over-Year, Reflecting Smarter Execution**
 
<img width="899" height="477" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3d7b2e47-74f1-42a3-95c0-2cfebe24b62e" />

Year-over-year analysis shows a clear improvement in efficiency from 2024 to 2025.

•	Average ROAS increased from the low–mid 40s in early 2024 to 50+ consistently in 2025.

•	Top-performing 2025 campaigns recorded ROAS values between 52 and 55, compared to 43–53 in 2024.

This improvement occurred without a dramatic drop in CPA, indicating better execution rather than reduced spending.
Performance gains were driven by optimization (targeting, creative, and allocation) rather than seasonality alone.

**Recommendations:**

•	Use high-performing 2025 campaigns as benchmarks.

•	Document and standardize targeting and creative strategies that drove ROAS gains.

•	Shift budget toward months and tactics with proven YoY efficiency.


# Insight 3
**Campaign Performance Is Driven by Intent, Not Volume**
 
<img width="975" height="376" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3af8e8ab-0257-43e8-bd95-acd0d21a78ad" />

Intent-driven seasonal campaigns clearly outperformed generic or low-intent initiatives.

•	Back-to-School ’25: CPA: $1.48, ROAS: 55.

•	Fall Campaign ’25: CPA: $1.41 (lowest overall), ROAS: 54.

In contrast:

•	Spring Campaign ’24 recorded the lowest ROAS at 43, despite a solid 12.57% conversion rate, signaling inefficient spend rather than weak demand.

Across almost every campaign type, 2025 versions outperformed their 2024 counterparts, with ROAS improvements of 2-6 points per campaign.
Campaign success is driven by user intent and timing, not exposure volume alone.
Intent-driven seasonal campaigns significantly outperformed generic initiatives because they targeted users with immediate needs and high purchase readiness, resulting in higher ROAS despite similar traffic volume.

**Recommendations:**

•	Prioritize seasonal and intent-led campaigns in budget planning.

•	Reduce spend on campaigns that generate volume without proportional revenue.

•	Time campaign launches around high-intent user behavior windows.


# Insight 4
**Instagram and LinkedIn Deliver the Highest Value per Dollar**
 
<img width="613" height="348" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0b7c30f-0e73-45bc-8f68-a17dc0d2e44e" />

While CPA differences across platforms were relatively narrow (approximately $1.41-$1.70), ROAS revealed clear performance gaps.

•	Instagram & LinkedIn: Highest ROAS with competitive CPA.

•	TikTok: Lower CPA, but consistently weaker ROAS, indicating lower revenue per conversion.

•	Facebook & X: Stable performance, but limited upside at scale.

A low CPA does not guarantee profitability; ROAS is the true indicator of platform value.

**Recommendations:**

•	Reallocate budget toward platforms with strong ROAS(Instagram and LinkedIn), not just low CPA.

•	Use TikTok and similar platforms for upper-funnel awareness, not revenue-heavy goals.

•	Track platform performance using CPA + ROAS together, not in isolation.


# Insight 5
**Audience Profitability Is Strongest Among Life-Stage Segments**

<img width="792" height="523" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/65073c8d-c4b3-4d9e-893f-ceedead902e8" />
 
Audience-level performance showed clear differences in profitability.

•	Gen X & Parents: Highest ROAS across platforms.

•	Professionals: Highest CPA and lowest ROAS, despite strong engagement.

•	Millennials & Gen Z: Consistent mid-range performance with predictable outcomes.

**Recommendations:**

•	Scale Gen X and Parent audiences on high-performing platforms (e.g., Instagram).

•	Narrow Professional targeting to high-intent use cases.


# Insight 6
**Engagement Depends on Format, Theme, and Timing.**

Content analysis revealed:

•	Stories, Carousels, and Reels drive the highest engagement

<img width="489" height="347" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/83f7538b-e2de-498b-9f53-c943df1c3892" />

•	Behind-the-scenes and lifestyle content perform best for interaction
 
<img width="680" height="377" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e334325a-95fa-4037-a07a-adc808dc6459" />

Timing analysis showed clear engagement peaks on Monday mornings and Saturday mid-day, while late-night posting consistently underperformed.
 
<img width="975" height="300" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6cf9ca99-0d55-4e10-9126-5621ea6f3416" />

This confirms that engagement is driven by content × format × timing, not content alone.

**Recommendations:**

•	Separate Engagement and Conversion Strategies
Use Stories, Carousels, and Reels for awareness and warming audiences, while relying on promotions, product launches, and value-driven messaging for conversion-focused goals.

•	Optimize Posting Schedule.

• Concentrate posting during proven high-engagement windows and reduce activity during low-performing periods to improve efficiency.

 
**Expected Impact:**

•	Higher ROAS without increased spend.

•	Reduced budget waste.

•	Stronger funnel progression

•	More predictable campaign performance.

**In Summary**, this project evaluated end-to-end marketing performance across 12M+ impressions, multiple campaigns, platforms, audiences, and content strategies to understand what truly drives ROI and where marketing spend is being wasted.

By analyzing funnel metrics, ROAS, CPA, engagement rates, and conversion performance, the analysis moved beyond surface-level reporting to uncover actionable insights across the full customer journey — from awareness to conversion.

The findings revealed that:

•	Marketing reach is strong, but conversion efficiency is low: Over 12.1 million impressions generated only 39,697 conversions, revealing that awareness is not the bottleneck. The largest opportunity lies in improving mid- and bottom-funnel performance.

•	Marketing efficiency improved year-over-year: Monthly ROAS in early 2025 consistently outperformed 2024, indicating better optimization and targeting. However, late-2024 ROAS spikes suggest seasonality rather than repeatable performance.

•	Higher ad spend does not guarantee proportional revenue growth: The spend-to-revenue relationship shows diminishing returns at higher spend levels, signaling the need for efficiency-driven scaling rather than budget inflation.

•	Campaign performance varies significantly: A small number of campaigns deliver the majority of returns, while others operate at high CPA with weak ROAS, pulling down overall efficiency.

•	Platforms contribute differently to performance: Instagram drives higher overall ROAS, while LinkedIn delivers stronger cost efficiency (lower CPA). Performance depends on platform role rather than volume alone.

•	Audience performance is platform-dependent: The same audience segments perform very differently across platforms, confirming that targeting effectiveness depends on where the audience is reached.

•	Content format and timing materially affect engagement: Interactive formats (Stories, Carousels, Reels) outperform static content, and engagement varies by posting time, showing that content strategy directly influences funnel performance.

Most importantly, this project demonstrated how data-driven decision-making can unlock more revenue without increasing marketing spend.

# Conclusion

This analysis shows how marketing performance improves when decisions are guided by efficiency, intent, and profitability — not assumptions or vanity metrics.

Rather than recommending higher budgets, the insights highlight opportunities to:

• Improve conversion efficiency within an already large funnel.

• Reallocate spend toward high-ROI platforms and audiences.

• Scale campaigns aligned with clear user intent.

• Separate engagement strategies from conversion strategies.

• Optimize timing to maximize impact from existing content.
